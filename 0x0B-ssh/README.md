## Context
A server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality
for other programs or devices, called 'clients'.<br/>
The role of a server is to share data as well as to share resources and distribute work. A Server
computer can serve its own computer program as well; depending on the scenario.

The following table shows several scenarios in which a server is used.
|:Server type:|:Purpose:|:Client:|
|-------------|---------|--------|
Application server | Hosts wep apps allowing users in the network to run and use them, without
having to copy on their own computers. These servers do not need to be part of the www; any local
network would do | Computers with a web browser
Communications server | Maintains an environment needed for one communication endpoint to find other
endpoints and communicate with them. | Communication endpoints (users or devices)
Database server | Maintains and shares any form of database over a network | Spreadsheets, accounting
software or virutally any computer program that consumes well-organized data, especially in large volumes
File server | Shares files and folders, storage space to hold files and/or folder over network | Networked computers are the intended clients, even though local programs can be clients
Proxy server | Acts as an intermediary between a client and a server, accepting incoming traffic from the client and sending it to the server. Reasons for doing so include content control and filtering, improving traffic performance, preventing unauthorized network access or simply routing the traffic over a large and complex network | Any network computer
Virtual server | Shares hardware and software resources with other virtual servers. It exists only as defined within specialized software called hypervisor | Any networked computer
Web server | Hosts web pages. A web server is what make the World Wide Web possible | Computers with a web browser
